Hello there.

I'm Roshan. I make stuff sometimes.  
These things&mdash;they're not very impressive.

I'm still going to put them on the internet&mdash;because why not?

Here's a bunch I'm particularly fond of:

- [Sympy based CAS](https://github.com/weakit/calc9000)
- [Tic Tac Toe (w/ AI)](https://github.com/weakit/GCI19-TicTacToe)
- [A rather stupid lyrics scraper for mp3s](https://github.com/weakit/lyrics-scraper)
- [A Terminal User Interface (in disguise)](https://github.com/weakit/bank9000)
- [This website](https://github.com/weakit/stuff)
- [And this beauty](/higher-brain-functions/)
